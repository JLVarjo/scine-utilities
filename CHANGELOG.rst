Changelog
=========

All changes are grouped into one of three categories: those changes that are considered
being related to features, meaning that they add or update new functionalities,
those that are considered important technical updates, and all other notable updates.
It is intended that only the first two groups (``New Features and Feature Updates`` and
``Important Technical Changes``) are important for the average user, while
the last one is mainly aimed at developers and users that link deeply into the code.

Release 10.0.0
--------------

Important Technical Changes
...........................

- Tests for the QM/MM transition state optimizer
- In case the atom coordinates given to a `GeometryOptimizer` are identical to the coordinates
  of the underlying calculator and a `Hessian` is requested,
  it is checked if this result is already present in the calculator to avoid an unnecessary calculation.
- The Thermochemical Calculator can now be constructed with a `PartialHessian`.
- The property `PartialGradients` is now available. It is intended to signal different contributions
  to the total gradients, e.g., the QM gradient contribution and the MM gradient contribution in QM/MM.
- Added a class to store derivatives in a more flexible manner.
- The Harmonic oscillator, particle-in-a-box, static-rotor free energy for zero Kelvin is now set to the
  sum of the electronic energy and zero point vibrational energy.
- Fixed a bug which lead to a crash when extracting thermochemical information from the Orca output for a
  temperature of zero Kelvin.
- Relative paths for the point charge file in electrostatic embedding calculations with Orca may now be used.
- More basis sets supported by Turbomole calculator.
- Pickle support for ElementType.
- The DFT grid for calculations with Turbomole is now set to 'm4' if Hessians are requested and the grid was
  too coarse for reliable Hessians (1 - 3, m3).
- Added support for lists of lists of integers as generic values.
- Added support for None in the Python bindings of the extract method of the Settings class.
- Allow writing pdb trajectory files.
- Fixes a bug where the coordinates in XYZ trajectory files were no longer separated by white spaces.
- Fixed a bug where the coordinates in PDB files were wrong if the code was compiled with clang.

Important Technical Changes
...........................
- PeriodicSystem canonicalizes the given PeriodicBoundaries to ensure read/write stability

- Settings for placing solvent molecules are summarized in ``SolventPlacementSettings``, all solvate functions
  take only this structure as input. This change is not backwards compatible.
