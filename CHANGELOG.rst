Changelog
=========

All changes are grouped into one of three categories: those changes that are considered
being related to features, meaning that they add or update new functionalities,
those that are considered important technical updates, and all other notable updates.
It is intended that only the first two groups (``New Features and Feature Updates`` and
``Important Technical Changes``) are important for the average user, while
the last one is mainly aimed at developers and users that link deeply into the code.

Release 6.0.0
-------------

New Features and Feature Updates
................................
- Newton Trajectory: Added new extraction options and improved eta bonds in NT2
- Added more solvents for the Turbomole input creator

Important Technical Changes
...........................
- PeriodicSystem canonicalizes the given PeriodicBoundaries to ensure read/write stability
