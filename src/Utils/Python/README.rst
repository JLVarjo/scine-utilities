SCINE - Utilities Python Bindings
=================================

Introduction
------------

This repository contains functionality which is used in most SCINE modules.
It is vital for the correct functioning of all SCINE modules, but it does not
directly provide any functionality for end users.


Installation and Usage
----------------------

We currently offer only a ``manylinux2014`` build for Linux platforms. This may
be expanded in the future. If you are on a different platform, you can build 
the Python bindings from source (https://github.com/qcscine/utilities/).


Support and Contact
-------------------

In case you should encounter problems or bugs, please write a short message
to scine@phys.chem.ethz.ch.
